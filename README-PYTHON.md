import hudkeep
CONTAINER_URL = "https://dlprojectsdataprod.blob.core.windows.net/sandbox"

list_stored("RE", CONTAINER_URL)
store("README.md", "README-blob.md", CONTAINER_URL) # Store
store("hudkeep/__init__.py", "README-blob.md", CONTAINER_URL) # Overwrite - won't work, because the hashes don't match
store("hudkeep/__init__.py", "README-blob.md", CONTAINER_URL, forced = TRUE) # Overwrite - will work, because of the forced flag
retrieve("README-blob.md", "test-local.R", CONTAINER_URL)
```
